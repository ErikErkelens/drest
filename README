DESCRIPTION:

dRest is a configurable HTTP/REST client library.  It's goal is to make 
the creation of API clients easier and maximizing re-usable code.     

USAGE:

    import drest

    conn = drest.Connection('http://localhost:8000/api/v1/')
    
    # by default, auth() just appends its params to the URL so name the
    # parameters however you want them passed as.
    conn.auth(api_user='john.doe', api_key='XXXXXXXXXXXX')
    
    # make calls openly
    response, data = conn.request('GET', '/user/2')
    
    # or attach a resource
    conn.add_resource('user')
    
    # get all resource objects
    response, data = conn.user.get()

    for user in data['objects']:
        print user['username']

    # get a single resource object
    response, data = conn.user.get(2)
    
    # update a resource
    new_data = data.copy()
    new_data['first_name'] = 'John'
    new_data['last_name'] = 'Doe'
    
    response, data = conn.user.update(data['id'], new_data)
