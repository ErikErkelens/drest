DESCRIPTION:

dRest is a configurable HTTP/REST client library.  It's goal is to make 
the creation of API clients dead simple, without lacking features.  Support 
for Python 2.6+ and Python 3+.

USAGE:

    import drest

    # Create a generic client api object
    api = drest.API('http://localhost:8000/api/v1/')
    
    # By default, auth() just appends its params to the URL so name the
    # parameters however you want them passed as.
    api.auth(api_user='john.doe', password='XXXXXXXXXXXX')
    
    # Make calls openly
    response, data = api.request('GET', '/users/1/')
    
    # Or attach a resource
    api.add_resource('users')
    
    # Get available resources
    api.resources
    
    # Get all objects of a resource
    response, objects = api.users.get()
    
    # Get a single resource with primary key '1'
    response, object = api.users.get(1)
    
    # Update a resource with primary key '1'
    response, data = api.users.get(1)
    updated_data = data.copy()
    updated_data['first_name'] = 'John'
    updated_data['last_name'] = 'Doe'
    
    response, object = api.users.update(data['id'], updated_data)
    
    # Create a resource
    user_data = dict(
                    username='john.doe',
                    password'oober-secure-password',
                    first_name='John',
                    last_name'Doe',
                    )
    response, data = api.users.create(user_data)
    
    # Delete a resource with primary key '1'
    response, data = api.users.delete(1)
